# The new mtylr.com

Welcome to my new and redesigned website! We are at about the one year mark since I decided to teach myself basic web development skills and techniques. In celebration of this upcoming anniversary, I saw it fitting to put my skills to the test with a newly redesigned web page layout.

This website uses a new technology Jekyll which will allow me to easily add and adapt my ideas. As I continue to build upon my web development skills, I aim to translate those skills and techniques onto this website and other web development projects which may come up in the future.
